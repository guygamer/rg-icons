I was frustrated with how poor png graphics look when used as icons and using svg files was proving problematic.  So I decided to create my own set of icons as an icon font that would look crisp and sharp at all sizes (including Retina displays) and could be easily manipulated.  I tried to create simple and clear icons that would be easily recognisable at any size whilst also capturing the spirit of the original client and provider logos.  I anticipate adding more icons in the future on an as-needed basis.\r\n\r\n###How to use\r\nJust follow these simple steps:\r\n 1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/thatbritguy/bg-icons/releases/latest)\r\n 2. Extract the files and copy to your project\r\n 3. Ensure the CSS is correctly referenced\r\n 4. Include the icons by using the \"bg\" class followed by the icon name: `<i class=\"bg bg-logo\"></i>`\r\n 5. Manipulate the icon as you would any other font, ex: `<i class=\"bg bg-logo\" style=\"font-family:'bg-icons';font-size:28px;font-weight: normal;color:#00ff00\"></i>`\r\n\r\nTo see a full list of included icons along with the correct icon name to use please see the `bg-icons-demo.html` file included in the root of the bg-icons source.\r\n \r\n###Special classes\r\nYou can use some special classes I created to quickly customise any bg-icon.  Just include these modifiers to the class:\r\n * `bg-xs` - 16px size - ideal for buttons and icons, ex: `<i class=\"bg bg-logo bg-xs\"></i>`\r\n * `bg-inverse` - inverted icon - ideal if using bg-icons on a dark background, ex: `<i class=\"bg bg-logo bg-inverse\"></i>`\r\n * `bg-[name]-c` - coloured icon - use a brand-coloured version of an icon by appending `-c` to the name, ex: `<i class=\"bg bg-logo-c\"></i>`\r\n \r\n###Requests\r\nIf you're using bg-icons in your project and want an icon for any software/service that isn't included feel free to open an issue and make a request.  I'll try to get round to these if and when I get chance.  bg-icons is a project I work on in my free time and sometimes life gets busy so no guarantees.\r\n\r\nPlease start the title of any request with [REQUEST] and include an image of the logo it is to be based on in the request itself (this is easy to do on github!).\r\n\r\n*NB - Please only request icons for known software and services.  No requests for personal designs and nothing of a lewd or adult nature.*\r\n\r\n###Version History\r\n * v1.2.0 2015-04-28\r\n  - Added bg-icons logo\r\n  - Added two alternative icons for Plex\r\n  - Added brand-coloured style for icons: append `-c` to an icon name to activate\r\n  - Updated bg-icons demo to reflect latest changes and show colour options\r\n  - Dropped support for versions of IE lower than IE8\r\n\r\n * v1.1.0 2015-04-26\r\n  - Initial public release\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
